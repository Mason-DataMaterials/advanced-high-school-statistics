\eoce{\qt{Parameters and statistics} Identify which value represents the sample mean and which value represents the claimed population mean.
\begin{parts}
\item A recent article in a college newspaper stated that college students get an average of 5.5 hrs of sleep each night. A student who was skeptical about this value decided to conduct a survey by randomly sampling 25 students. On average, the sampled students slept 6.25 hours per night.
\item American households spent an average of about \$52 in 2007 on Halloween merchandise such as costumes, decorations and candy. To see if this number had changed, researchers conducted a new survey in 2008 before industry numbers were reported. The survey included 1,500 households and found that average Halloween spending was \$58 per household.
\item The average GPA of students in 2001 at a private university was 3.37. A survey on a sample of 203 students from this university yielded an average GPA of 3.59 in Spring semester of 2012.

\eoce{\qt{Days off at a mining plant} Workers at a particular mining site receive an average of 35 days paid vacation, which is lower than the national average. The manager of this plant is under pressure from a local union to increase the amount of paid time off. However, he does not want to give more days off to the workers because that would be costly. Instead he decides he should fire 10 employees in such a way as to raise the average number of days off that are reported by his employees. In order to achieve this goal, should he fire employees who have the most number of days off, least number of days off, or those who have about the average number of days off?

\eoce{\qt{Side effects of Avandia, Part I\label{AvandiaTrueFalse}} Rosiglitazone is the active ingredient in the controversial type~2 diabetes medicine Avandia and has been linked to an increased risk of serious cardiovascular problems such as stroke, heart failure, and death. A common alternative treatment is pioglitazone, the active ingredient in a diabetes medicine called Actos. In a nationwide retrospective observational study of 227,571 Medicare beneficiaries aged  65 years or older, it was found that 2,593 of the 67,593 patients using rosiglitazone and 5,386 of the 159,978 using pioglitazone had serious cardiovascular problems. These data are summarized in the contingency table below. \footfullcite{Graham:2010}

Determine if each of the following statements is true or false. If false, explain why. \textit{Be careful:} The reasoning may be wrong even if the statement's conclusion is correct. In such cases, the statement should be considered false.
\begin{parts}
\item Since more patients on pioglitazone had cardiovascular problems (5,386 vs. 2,593), we can conclude that the rate of cardiovascular problems for those on a pioglitazone treatment is higher.
\item The data suggest that diabetic patients who are taking rosiglitazone are more likely to have cardiovascular problems since the rate of incidence was (2,593 / 67,593 = 0.038) 3.8\% for patients on this treatment, while it was only (5,386 / 159,978 = 0.034) 3.4\% for patients on pioglitazone. \textPE{\textbf{(Note: parts~(c) and~(d) are on the next page.)}}
\item The fact that the rate of incidence is higher for the rosiglitazone group proves that rosiglitazone causes serious cardiovascular problems.
\item Based on the information provided so far, we cannot tell if the difference between the rates of incidences is due to a relationship between the two variables or due to chance.

\eoce{\qt{Heart transplants} The Stanford University Heart Transplant Study was conducted to determine whether an experimental heart transplant program increased lifespan. Each patient entering the program was designated an official heart transplant candidate, meaning that he was gravely ill and would most likely benefit from a new heart. Some patients got a transplant and some did not. The variable \texttt{transplant} indicates which group the patients were in; patients in the treatment group got a transplant and those in the control group did not. Another variable called \texttt{survived} was used to indicate whether or not the patient was alive at the end of the study. Of the 34 patients in the control group, 4 were alive at the end of the study. Of the 69 patients in the treatment group, 24 were alive. The contingency table below summarizes these results.\footfullcite{Turnbull+Brown+Hu:1974}

\begin{parts}
\item What proportion of patients in the treatment group and what proportion of patients in the control group died?
\item One approach for investigating whether or not the treatment is effective is to use a randomization technique.
\begin{subparts}
\item What are the claims being tested?
\item  The paragraph below describes the set up for such approach, if we were to do it without using statistical software. Fill in the blanks with a number or phrase, whichever is appropriate.
\begin{adjustwidth}{2em}{2em}
We write \textit{alive} on \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} cards representing patients who were alive at the end of the study, and \textit{dead} on \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} cards representing patients who were not. Then, we shuffle these cards and split them into two groups: one group of size \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} representing treatment, and another group of size \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} representing control. We calculate the difference between the proportion of \textit{dead} cards in the treatment and control groups (treatment - control) and record this value. We repeat this 100 times to build a distribution centered at \rule{2cm}{0.5pt}. Lastly, we calculate the fraction of simulations where the simulated differences in proportions are \rule{2cm}{0.5pt}. If this fraction is low, we conclude that it is unlikely to have observed such an outcome by chance and that the null hypothesis (independence model) should be rejected in favor of the alternative.

While in reality we would carry out the simulations required for randomization using statistical software, suppose we actually simulate using index cards. In order to simulate from the independence model, which states that the outcomes were independent of the treatment, we write whether or not each patient had a cardiovascular problem on cards, shuffled all the cards together, then deal them into two groups of size 67,593 and 159,978. We repeat this simulation 1,000 times and each time record the number of people in the rosiglitazone group who had cardiovascular problems. Below is a relative frequency histogram of these counts. \\
\begin{subparts}
\item What are the claims being tested?
\item Compared to the number calculated in part (b), which would provide more support for the alternative hypothesis,  \textit{more} or \textit{fewer} patients with cardiovascular problems in the rosiglitazone group?
\item What do the simulation results suggest about the relationship between taking rosiglitazone and having cardiovascular problems in diabetic patients?

\eoce{\qt{Sinusitis and antibiotics, Part II} Researchers studying the effect of antibiotic treatment compared to symptomatic treatment for acute sinusitis randomly assigned 166 adults diagnosed with sinusitis into two groups (as discussed in Exercise~\ref{sinusitis}). Participants in the antibiotic group received a 10-day course of an antibiotic, and the rest received symptomatic treatments as a placebo. These pills had the same taste and packaging as the antibiotic. At the end of the 10-day period patients were asked if they experienced improvement in symptoms since the beginning of the study. The distribution of responses is summarized below. \footfullcite{Garbutt:2012}

\item What type of a study is this?
\item Does this study make use of blinding?
\item At first glance, does antibiotic or placebo appear to be more effective for the treatment of sinusitis? Explain your reasoning using appropriate statistics.
\item There are two competing claims that this study is used to compare: the independence model and the alternative model. Write out these competing claims in easy-to-understand language and in the context of the application. \textit{Hint:} The researchers are studying the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment.
\item Based on your finding in (c), does the evidence favor the alternative model? If not, then explain why. If so, what would you do to check if whether this is strong evidence?
